# Architectural Principles: Defense in Depth & Hardening Baselines

Security misconfiguration is fundamentally a failure of security architecture and operational governance.

### Defense in Depth Principles:
1. **Repeatable Hardening Process:** Deploying a secure environment should be completely automated through configuration management tools (Ansible, Terraform, Puppet) rather than manual ad-hoc setup.
2. **Minimal Surface Area:** Disable unused modules, framework features, ports, and default sample components. If a service is not required for business operations, remove it.
3. **Segregated Environments:** Development and staging environments with active debug flags must never touch production databases or live operational credentials.
